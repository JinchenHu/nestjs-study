(A) Types of DI    {cm:2021-01-11}
    constructor injection, field injection (look for a clear example) {cm:2021-01-11}
    setter injection (existing?) {cm:2021-01-11}
    Do we use REQUEST scope only?

(B) Scopes of provider. Singleton, any other types? (e.g., prototype)

(C) `@Inject('')`, could we variable name?

(D) properties of imports and exports in `@Module` {c} {cm:2021-01-11}
    how to use them -> how to import an exported provider in a Module {cm:2021-01-08}
    How to use an imported provider, do we need to put it in the list of providers?
    imports Module vs. Service, all vs. specific?

(E) Dependency injection in Module class -- look for an example
 
(F) What does it mean when forRoutes() method takes controller class? {c}
    Possible but not sure

(G) Codes in Exception filter, such as ArgumentsHost, Generics, unknown (catch everything)        {cm:2021-01-11}
    Difference between interface ExceptionFilter vs. Class BaseExceptionFilter

(H) Difference between middleware and interception

(I) Find some examples of async providers (TypeORM) and custom providers (useFactory, non-class-based provider)
    what does @Inject exactly do in custom providers?

(J) Examples for configuration modules
 



(X) Technologies in Architecture docs -- which are important, super related to the next work    {c}
(Y) Arrow function or normal function?  {c} {cm:2021-01-11}
