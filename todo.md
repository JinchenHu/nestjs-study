(A) Types of DI    {cm:2021-01-11}
    constructor injection, field injection (look for a clear example) {cm:2021-01-11}
    setter injection (existing?) {cm:2021-01-11}
    Do we use singleton type scope only? {cm:2021-01-12}

(B) Scopes of provider. Singleton, any other types? (e.g., prototype) {cm:2021-01-12}

(C) `@Inject('')`, could we variable name? {cm:2021-01-12}

(D) properties of imports and exports in `@Module` {c} {cm:2021-01-11}
    how to use them -> how to import an exported provider in a Module {cm:2021-01-08}
    How to use an imported provider, do we need to put it in the list of providers?
    imports Module vs. Service, all vs. specific?

(E) Dependency injection in Module class -- look for an example {cm:2021-01-12}
 
(F) What does it mean when forRoutes() method takes controller class? {c} {cm:2021-01-12}
    Possible but not sure

(G) Codes in Exception filter, such as ArgumentsHost, Generics, unknown (catch everything)        {cm:2021-01-11}
    Difference between interface ExceptionFilter vs. Class BaseExceptionFilter {cm:2021-01-12}

(H) Difference between middleware and interception {cm:2021-01-12}

(I) Find some examples of async providers (TypeORM) and custom providers (useFactory, non-class-based provider what does @Inject exactly do in custom providers?

(J) Examples for configuration modules
 
(K) value of entity key in ormconfig.json file

(M) Use interface or defined entity in entity schemas?

(X) Technologies in Architecture docs -- which are important, super related to the next work    {c}
(Y) Arrow function or normal function?  {c} {cm:2021-01-11}
